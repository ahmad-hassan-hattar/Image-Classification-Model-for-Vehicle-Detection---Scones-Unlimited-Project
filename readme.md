# Image Classification Model for Vehicle Detection (ML Workflow For Scones Unlimited On Amazon SageMaker)

## Introduction
Welcome to the Image Classification Model for Vehicle Detection project! In this project, I have successfully completed the development of an image classification model designed to identify different types of vehicles in images. This model will be beneficial for Scones Unlimited, a logistics company with a focus on scone delivery. The model's applications include routing delivery drivers to the appropriate loading bays based on their vehicles, detecting defects in scones, and enhancing social media engagement through accurate vehicle recognition.

## Background
Image classifiers play a crucial role in the field of computer vision, enabling the identification of various objects within images. This technology finds applications in diverse industries, ranging from autonomous vehicles and augmented reality to eCommerce platforms and medical diagnostics.

## Project Details
As a Machine Learning Engineer at Scones Unlimited, I embarked on developing an image classification model tailored for identifying the types of vehicles owned by the delivery drivers. The primary objective was to optimize the delivery process by assigning appropriate routes to drivers based on their vehicles. For instance, bicycle-riding delivery professionals would be assigned nearby orders, while motorcyclists would receive orders that are farther away.

## Features
- Built an image classification model capable of distinguishing between bicycles and motorcycles.
- Utilized AWS Sagemaker for model development and training.
- Deployed the trained model using AWS Lambda functions and AWS Step Functions.
- Created an event-driven application to integrate the model into Scones Unlimited's operations.
- Implemented safeguards to monitor and manage model performance and drift.

## Instructions for Deployment
1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Set up an AWS account if you don't have one.
3. Install necessary dependencies as specified in the project's requirements.
4. Follow the provided notebooks to develop and train the image classification model using AWS Sagemaker.
5. Deploy the trained model using AWS Lambda and integrate it with AWS Step Functions for event-driven processing.
6. Test the model with sample images and ensure it accurately classifies bicycles and motorcycles.
7. Monitor the deployed model's performance and implement mechanisms to detect and handle drift or degraded performance.

## Conclusion
With the successful completion of this project, I have demonstrated my ability to develop, deploy, and manage a scalable and efficient image classification model using AWS services. This portfolio-ready demo showcases the potential of machine learning in optimizing logistics and operational processes. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out.
